=========================
Cenit Integrations Client
=========================

Cenit Integrations Client allows you to integrate your Odoo system with many
third party services available over the internet using the `cenitsaas`_
platform as data integrator.

Overview
========

- The `cenitsaas`_ platform provides a set of models that allow you to map your
  data once and send it transparently to any service supported by the platform.

- The `cenitsaas`_ platform is free and community friendly, and makes use of
  open source and standards so that community driven development is easier.

Documentation
=============

The Cenit Integrations Client groups its provided models in two categories
describing *what* data you want to be able to send/receive and *when* you want
to send/receive the data.

Data definitions
----------------

The models gathered here describe the *what*, they manipulate the Odoo data to
shape it in a way that is consistent with supported third party services.

**Libraries**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Libraries* are a mere logical organization of the data. They exist solely for
the purpose of organizing *Schemas* and *Data types*.

Fields
~~~~~~

**name**: string
    The name of the *Library*.

**Schemas**
~~~~~~~~~~~

*Schemas* are the fundamental stone of the `cenitsaas`_ platform models. They
define the way data is stored and transmitted.

Fields
~~~~~~

library: reference
    The *Library* to which the *Schema* belongs.

uri: string
    Identifies the *Schema* and most therefore be unique for each *Library*.

    Commonly is formed by the name of the *Schema* followed by an extension
    describing the format used (currently supported are 'json' and 'xml').

*schema*: string
    The actual schema describing the data. It should match the extension
    provided in the **uri**.

    It can be blank (thought that wouldn't do much).

**Data types**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Data types* represent a mapping between an existing Odoo model and a *Schema*.

Fields
~~~~~~

name: string
    The name of the *Data type*.

model: reference
    The Odoo model that will by associated with the *Data type*.

library: reference
    The *Library* to which the *Data type* belongs.

*schema*: reference
    The *Schema* against which the **model** will be mapped.

*active*: boolean
    If unchecked the *Data type* will be stored but not used.

*mapping*: structure
    The **mapping** describes how to translate the **model** to the **schema**.

    It consists of a series of **mapping** lines, describing what **model** data
    should go into what **schema** property.

    **odoo**: represents an actual value to use.

    **cenit**: the name of the property that will store the value expressed in
               **odoo**.

    **type**: one of four:

        field: tells the *Data type* that the value expressed in **odoo** is the
            name of a field in the **model** (say ``obj.name``). This does
            not allow using nested fields (that is: ``obj.rel_id.name`` will
            cause breakdown).

        model: tells the *Data type* that the value expressed in **odoo** is a
            reference to other *Data type*. This means that when
            sending/receiving the data, the related Odoo model will also be
            serialized/deserialized and fully processed as if it were the one
            that triggered the action.

        reference: tells the *Data type* that the value expressed in **odoo** is
            a reference to other model not mapped by any *Data type*. In
            this case the field ``name`` of the related model is used as
            an identifier.

        default: tells the *Data type* that the value expressed in **odoo**
            should be treated as a string literal, which can contain replacement
            patterns in the form of ``{field_name}`` where ``field_name`` is the
            name of a field in the **model**.

            This form does allow the use of nested fields (e.g:
            ``{rel_id.name}``). Also the value of a default field can be a json
            structure, in which case the json brackets should be doubled:
            ``{{`` and ``}}`` (e.g: ``{{client: "{client.name}"}}``).

    reference: used when **type** is ``Model``.

        This refers to a *Data type* against which the value of **odoo** is
        mapped.

    cardinality: used when **type** is ``Model``.

        This refers to whether the value of **odoo** represents a single object
        (``2one``) or many (``2many``).

    primary: if checked, the field will be used as an identifier when receiving
        data.
